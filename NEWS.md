# DtD 0.2.2
* Use profile likelihood function with MLE. This is faster and more precise.
* Use the same optimization method as optimize.
* Fixed errors in vignette.

# DtD 0.2.1
* Fixed typos and errors in vignette.

# DtD 0.2.0
* More stable computations are used in the iterative method. Thus, the results 
  of the methods may have been changed slightly.
* A method have been added to compute the parameters over a rolling window.
* A method have been added to compute the log-likelihood.
